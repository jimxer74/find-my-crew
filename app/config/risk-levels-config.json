    "title": "Coastal sailing",
    "infoText": "Coastal sailing is one of the most accessible and enjoyable ways to experience sailing. It typically involves cruising along shorelines, bays, inlets, islands, or large lakes/seas, staying relatively close to land—often within sight of the coast or just a few hours from safe harbors, anchorages, or marinas. Trips are usually day sails, weekend overnights, or multi-day hops between ports, covering 20–150 miles over a week or so, with frequent stops for exploration, swimming, meals ashore, or sightseeing.\n\nUnlike true offshore or ocean passages (where you're days or weeks from help), coastal sailing offers a mix of protected waters (e.g., bays, sounds, archipelagos like the San Juan Islands, Chesapeake Bay, Florida Keys, or Maine coast) and occasional short open-water crossings between islands or headlands. It's more about relaxed exploration, discovering new harbors, beaches, towns, and anchorages than enduring long isolation or extreme conditions. Weather can be planned around more easily (using short-term forecasts), and you can duck into shelter if things turn rough. Many people describe it as the \"sweet spot\" for family cruising, learning, or casual adventure—plenty of sailing fun without the full commitment of bluewater voyages.",

    "title": "Offshore sailing",
    "infoText": "Offshore sailing (also called bluewater or ocean sailing) involves passages where you're well away from land—typically out of sight of the coast for extended periods, often days to weeks or even months on ocean crossings (e.g., Atlantic trade-wind routes like the ARC, Pacific passages, or longer voyages). You're days or more from any safe harbor, rescue, or resupply, making self-sufficiency essential. Unlike coastal sailing's short hops with frequent land access, offshore means committing to the open ocean, dealing with whatever weather and conditions arise without quick escape options.\n\nIt's often described as a profound, immersive experience: the vast emptiness of the sea, constant motion, night watches under stars, the rhythm of trade winds, and the satisfaction of covering hundreds or thousands of miles under sail. Many find it meditative and exhilarating—freedom from daily life, deep crew bonds from shared watches and challenges, and the thrill of arriving after a long passage. But it's also demanding: fatigue from irregular sleep, physical wear from constant boat motion, and the mental strain of isolation and unpredictability. Passages can feel monotonous (long days of similar conditions) or intense (sudden gales, squalls, or gear failures).",
