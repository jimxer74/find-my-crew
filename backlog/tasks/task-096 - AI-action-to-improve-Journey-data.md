## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
AI should suggest actions to improve Journey and leg data for skippers. It should analyze different aspects of the Journey / leg data, identify missing, illogical or otherwise limited information that requires improvement. e.g. Journey has been designated as "Coastal sailing" even if it the legs cleary includes long offshore passages.
