## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A search capability that uses AI to find matches from the data. User can prompt wishes and aspirations, what kind of sailing, purpose and goal, e.g. adventure, learning, holiday, and AI will ask verfifying questions until there is enough information to find good matches from database. 

Here are example scenrarios of prompts and iterative reasoning of the required background information:

Scenario 1:
User: "I am looking for a Swan 38 or Baltic 42DP to sail in anywhere in finnish or swedish baltic coast. Timeline for this would be anytime during the summer, I have full month of vacation in July but weekends are also possible during summer months."

AI: Tell me about you prior sailing experiences, what kind of sailing you have done?

User: "Well. I have sailed....."

Scenario 2:
User: "I'd like to find someone to teach me basics of sailing near Stockholm, anykind of sailing boat is ok, big or small, I just need somene who has time and willingnes to show me the ropes"

AI: Great!, sailing is nice way to spend time in nature and sea, I am happy you have chosen to start learning sailing. I would like to still know few things, are you available at weekdays for short trips or only weekends? Or would you prefer longer trips, perhaps when you are on vacation during the summer?
 

Above is just possible examples, aspects that AI needs to resolve and make sure there is enough information are:

1. User goals and aspirations, why they are looking for sailing trip in first place? 
2. What kind of sailing user is looking for, adventure, laid back holiday, challage, exitement,  learning, etc. offshore, high latitudes. Warm and sunny, diving, snorekling, swimming, or colder climates with nature and wildlife, people or solitude
3. Very specific interests regarding the trip, location, time and availability, flexibility, a certain boat type or model, a certain size boat, small or big, luxury or classic
4. AI needs to be able to understand when there is enough information gathered to create a good matches in data.
