## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Possibility to invite other people to join the same registration for a leg. Invitation could be sent via multiple channels:
- In-app (if user is already in SailSmart)
- Email
- Whatsapp
- SMS / Phone
- Facebook Messenger

Maxmimum number of people asked to be joined in combined registration is the open crew positions available for the leg.

Combined registration would work so that if any of the users part of combined registration is not approved by the owner the whole group will be disapproved for the leg. Also there needs to be a clear visibility / feature to owner to see which registrations form a group that should be handled as one approval.

In autoapproval is enabled, the AI assessment is done for each individual registrants of the group, but the final autoapproval will be made as combined assessment of indivudal assessment results when all results are available. Owner can adjusta in Journey level that what is acceptable level when AI can autoapprove the whole group (e.g. 80% of the users in group mast get autoapprove ok result from individual assessment), if the threshold is not met, the whole group is set for owner verification. In group case AI assessment results cannot be displayed to users until all the assessments and final group level decision is made.
