## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Cost management is a critical aspect of organizing legs (short segments) or passages (longer voyages), as it affects crew recruitment, retention, and overall satisfaction. Based on standard practices in the sailing industry—drawn from crew-finding sites, forums, and yacht management resources—here are the main cost management models. These vary by voyage type, vessel ownership, and legal considerations (e.g., avoiding unintended commercial operations under regulations like UK MCA coding).
I'll break them down into categories, with examples of typical costs involved (e.g., food, fuel, marina fees, permits, insurance). Models can be mixed or customized, but transparency is key to building trust in apps like yours.

1. Shared Contribution Model (Crew and Owner Split Costs)

Description: All onboard costs are divided among the crew (and sometimes the owner) on a pre-agreed basis, often equally or proportional to time aboard. This is common for recreational or non-commercial voyages to ensure fairness.
Key Features: Costs like provisioning (food/water), fuel, gas, laundry, marina/mooring fees, and permits are pooled. Contributions might be £20-50 per person per day, depending on location (e.g., higher in remote areas like the Galapagos due to permits up to $1,500).
levels.

2. Owner Covers All Costs (Free Passage for Crew)

Description: The boat owner pays for everything, and crew joins without financial contribution. This is typical for "working passages" where crew provides labor in exchange.
Key Features: Covers all running costs (fuel, food, berthing) and sometimes travel to/from the boat. Crew might commit to watches, cleaning, or repairs.

3. Crew Pays a Fee (Paid Position or Contribution-Based)

Description: Crew pays a fixed daily or total fee to join, often covering their share plus a margin for the owner. This borders on charter territory and must comply with regulations to avoid being seen as commercial.
Key Features: Fees range from €15-50+ per day for basics (food, fuel) to £1,500+ for major passages, excluding airfares. Sometimes includes training or adventure elements.

4. Delivery or Paid Crew (Crew Receives Compensation)

Description: Professional or experienced crew are paid by the owner for their services, with all costs covered. This is common in luxury yachts or commercial operations and paid deliveries, either boat ownere being part of crew or boat operated completely by external paid crew.
Key Features: Wages (e.g., $100-300/day for delivery skippers) plus covered expenses. Owner handles all operational costs.

5. To be agreed
Description: Cost model is not defined at yet and will be negotiated and agreed later.
