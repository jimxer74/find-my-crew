## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
In order gain traction in highly competitive app marker space, there needs to be fast and immediate value creation for users. This means that crew users need to be shown the value the app can bring fast and without cumbersome signup and profile creationg flows supporting basic leg searching based on their given preferences immeadiately and without need to identigy themselves through sign-up -> login -> profile creation long flow

No changes should be done in current sign-up, log-in and profile creation flows, this is an additional new enhancement that can be used alongside the existing more traditional onboarding.
