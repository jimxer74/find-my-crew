## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
In order gain traction in highly competitive app marker space, there needs to be fast and immediate value creation for users. This means that crew users need to be shown the value the app can bring fast and without cumbersome signup and profile creationg flows supporting basic sailing opportunities searching based on their given preferences and aspirations immeadiately and without need to identify themselves through sign-up -> login -> profile creation long flow. The main idea here is the show users value early and be able to gather just enough information to show matching sailing opportunities, so that after seeing the value the app can bring, users would be willing sign-up.

No changes should be done in current sign-up, log-in and profile creation flows, this is an additional new enhancement that can be used alongside the existing more traditional onboarding.

No changes should be done in the current app landing page as of now, the new one will be created as an optional landing page for, which may in future replace the old, but not for now yet.

Here is the idea of the basic user flow:
1. New user comes in the app landing page, interested in crew positions and looking for sailiing opportunities

2. In new Landing page there is a very clear starting point for unidentified crew onboarding flow, user clicks to start the onboarding
** New landing page concept: We'll start with the basis of the current landing page, but remove the header component (no header or navigation visible). The landing page has the main logo, main hero texts and the current background image as now and Log-in button. It is split in two sides or columns for full height of the screen. Use different transparent color layers on top of the background image to enable this dualistic motif. Left hand side is for Owers / Skippers and we'll implement that in later task. Right hand side is for crew and it should have clear value proposition for crews to able find best matching sailing opportunites and button to start this new onboarding process.

3. User clicks the button to start onboarding process and it opens up very simplistic just bare screen with no header, but footer with acces to important legal texts. Page should have the AI assistant component in it for user to able to start discussing with AI assistant that will guide the user through the onboarding process.

4. AI assisted flow 1. step: Gain understanding of user's aspirations, goals and what kind persons they are in general.
- AI assistant's only target is to obtain just enough information from user to be able to show matching legs from database. AT MOST IMPORTANT is to understand the user's aspirations, goals and kind of sailing he/she is looking for
