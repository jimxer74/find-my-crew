## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Enable standard equipment to be defined the boat registry entries, so the boat in boat registry could have set of predefined products from Product registry linked to. 

When boat details are fetched and boat is created in boat registry, an AI search could be incorporated in the flow to fetch know standard equipment for the sailboat model. e.g. know that Hallberg-Rassy certain models use Volvo-Penta engines and Selden masts.
