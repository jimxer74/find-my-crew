## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Journey form is complex and detailed I might be too hard to fill. Create a way to apply "template" journey settings for stereotypical Journeys e.g, with needed crew requirements, levels, and registration settings

1. "Champagne sailing" -> very easy, coastal nice weather journey with low requirements for crew

2. "Offshore downwind passage" --> Relatively easy offshore journey, that requires bit more competent crew or at least a mix, e.g. atlantic crossing east to west or offshore passages in baltic sea or mediterranean

3. "Demanding offshore passage" --> More demanding offshore passage from weather and conditions or forecasting point of view, e.g. Atlantic crossing West to East. or 

4. "Challenging offshore passage" --> Hard offshore route in locations that are known for volatile weather and hard conditions. e.g. crossing or sailing in Gulf-stream, Drake passage, southern ocean in general, Bass straight etc.

There could be a AI driven tool that ownere could ask to help to assess the Journey and propose a correct setup from the settings point of view.
