## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create product registry for Boat Managemen that can be extended: e.g. engines_registry: contains a list of typical sailboat engine models and variants, winches_registry: contains typical winches. This could be single table, where categories are dedfined by the existing equipment structure in boat-management. 

Registry should provide: name specs of the equipment, link to manufacturer, link(s) to get spare parts, etc information, link(s) to product documentation

Target is not create comprenhensive product database, but provide quick access to most typical equipments: engines, gearboxes, masts and booms, chartplotters, radars, ais, gos, batteries, chargers, solar, winches, furlers, wind generators, inverters, instruments, anchors, vhf-radios, dinghies, outboards...

Concept is that users could find quickly a matching (autocomplete search) equipment for their boat, and if not found search a specific one that and  product would be added to product registry for others to use. Product registry could be initially seeded with small subset of the products.
