## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Bugs:
- In leg registration where passport if obligated, if user clicks cancel in passport promt, user is displayed the normal registration form and user can register without valid passport. This is serious bug, user cannot register if passport is obligated and user does not have valid passport.
- Onwere AI onboarding: Suggestion texts are way too long, instruct AI to provide short and concise suggested actions
- Owner AI onboarding hangs on "add boat" phase, and does not display the welcome message. Needs to better handle the error situations in the owner_session state
