## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
create a new tool for /welcome/owner AI assistant to search for the matching crew role users based on the given crew profile. Matching needs to be done againts all crew profile data, including the their availability location preferences, so that search would return best matching crew users for skippers needs and requirements that they have statated. This tool would be used preferably already in very beginning of the AI assistant flow, immediately after skipper has provided the initial information to AI before the sing-up to show the platform value and matching capabilities to convince skippers to continue the sign-in process.

Also a CrewCarousel component to be created, to display the matching crew in carousel format. Information to be displayed are at least image, name, experience level, comfort level, skills.
