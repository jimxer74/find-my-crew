## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Following documents needs to stored safely and secure way for users:
- Licenses and certifications (pdfs, scanned images, photos of documents)
- Identification documents such as: Passport, drivers license, any other form of official id card (scanned images)
- Skippers might have: Insurance papers, boat papers, registry certficates, etc..

These are just examples but are not limited to these, there would need to be a way to upload these into document vault and some form of automated classification system when uploading using AI / LLM for example, so there needs to way to store also some metadata with the uploaded documents. 

** IMPORTANT: this requires absolute security, no one can get access to document that the owner, and owner can then grant access to specified user(s) for example in case of automated registration, a Passport is required. then crew role user would need to grant access to potential skipper to see the passport, but this mechanism needs to be very carefully designed and only allow grant to specific use case and limited time. Also security measures needs to taken into consideration to prohibit any misuse of the sensitive documents, like downloading etc.  These were just exmples and the functionality needs to be throoughly designed to keep it safe.
