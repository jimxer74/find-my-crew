## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Similar approach as in task-053 this is for Owners.

Interactive and iterative conversational capability that is AI-driven for Owners to post in very simple way a demand for a crew. AI would prompt owner to describe the need for crew, e.g. what kind of skills, type, experience level, aspirations, motivational aspects they are looking for and ask clarifiying questions in order to gather enough infrmation for using the existing AI-assisted journey creation and fill in all the details automatically. 

As an end of the flow AI would be able automatically create the Journey with legs and all the neccessary information and display the summary to owner and owner could publish the journey or continue editing it further.
