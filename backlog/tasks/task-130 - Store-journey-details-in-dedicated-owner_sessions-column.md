## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a `journey_details` text column to `owner_sessions` to persist the parsed journey text (locations, dates, waypoints) from the front page ComboSearchBox, and label it as `[JOURNEY DETAILS]:` in the AI message — mirroring the skipper_profile/crew_requirements pattern so the AI has clearly-labelled, reliably-available context throughout the session.
