## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A Marketing Front Page for a Journey that would work as an appealing landing page to attract crew to join. This would require also editing and management capabilities for the content and graphics, videos etc. Idea here would be for boat owners to be able to create and publish a very polished and appealing looking marketing content for the Journey, perhaps using different AI tools for supporting in the content creation.
