## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A Marketing Front Page for a Journey that would work as an appealing landing page to attract crew to join. This would require also editing and management capabilities for the content and graphics, videos etc. Idea here would be for boat owners to be able to create and publish a very polished and appealing looking marketing content for the Journey, perhaps using different AI tools for supporting in the content creation.

Main principle here is that creating a such Journey landing page would be extremely easy and straigthforward to owners, they would only need to decide upon the UI concept, graphics and kind vibe they want to convey. It would be as easy as owner promptin to AI assistance to create a Journey landing page, by providing some descriptions of their preferences and what kind of vibe, and target audience, crew they are looking for. Also lot of the semantics for Journey can be looked up automaticaly from the Journey data, such as a boat, skipper profiles, journey and legs locations and their requirements etc.
