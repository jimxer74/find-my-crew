## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
User can provide and save predefined preferences for departure and arrival locations, and availability in profile edit, and in onboarding flow. This information can be used later in providing crew matches to skippers.

** Considerations:
- in /crew/dashboard set the the Search filters as default from the profile including all the filters e.g availability, locations, risk level, experience leve. 
- in /crew display the list based on the user defined preference in profile, take into consideration all the profile settings and display the locations that user as preferred in profile.

results filtering should work logically the same in /crew and /crew/dashboard. in /crew view show the best matching results first in the carousel.
