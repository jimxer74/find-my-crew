## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a Credits feature, where users can add credits to thei user account. Credits can be used for more costly operations e.g.

- An automated approval (usint high-end LLM model) would not be free but cost anywhere from 0,50 cents to 1 USD per each approval. --> To be decided if cost split can be defined between skipper or crew or is it allways crew to pay this? maybe skipper may offer this for free to crew

- High fidelity or granularity Journey creation using frontier AI model to create real world usable navigation routes taking into consideration potential hazards, wheather patterns etc. like using advanced routing features would be behind paywall

- Maybe enable leg / joyrney payments to skippers if leg  is not free?
- Maybe enable donation to shared cruising kitty for a journey?
