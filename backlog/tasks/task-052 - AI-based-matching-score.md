## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Instead of just crude skills based matching, a dailly run AI matching algorithm would be done that could calculate a more sophisticated score based on all information available from profiles etc. Daily run would read a delta of new or updated profiles and new or updated journeys and legs, and calculate a match percentage.
