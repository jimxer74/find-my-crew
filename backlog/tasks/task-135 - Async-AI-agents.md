## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a shared capability to enable agentic AI workflows and longer processing in background. AI agentic workflow can be started as scheduled job, or explicitly by user. There should be a capability to display progress to user and indicate when wokflow is finalized. 

Technology: Consider options that are easy to incorporate in current architecture, Vercel or perhaps Supabase may be even better, + other alternatives pros and cons. There are some docs about this alredy, please read them from docs.
