## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Plan for making a first MVP production deployment:

Few example tasks, but not limited to, please define all required tasks for production deployment:
- Plan for first simple but working production architecture that is adequate for small pilot
- Plan for CI/CD pipeline
- Investigate codebase for security issues and vulnerabilities
- Prepare codebase for production
- Make configurable hard limits for different release types, e.g. full production (will be defined later), Pilot production (maximum boats per user 1, max journeys per user 2, max number of registered users 50)

Please propose other needed things as well.
