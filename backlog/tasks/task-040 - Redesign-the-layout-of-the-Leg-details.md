## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Order of the content in pane:

- Boat image carousel in top taking the full width of the pane
- Badges overlayed on the boat image: match, risk level (coastal, offshore, extreme), match opens the detailed view on what skills are mateched and what are missing and also the minimum experience level. Risk level badge opens the description of the risk level.
- Leave close button as is overlayed on boat image in top right
- Leg name and Journey name
- Leg start and end places, dates
- Leg distance and duration
- Show the Mimumum experience level warning if there is a mismatch. If minimum experience level is matched, do not show it here (it is visible through the badge link)
- Skipper avatar and name, maybe some information on skipper skills? let's decide that later
- Show Journey description, truncate if very long and display a button to "Show more" that opens the full description in dialog
