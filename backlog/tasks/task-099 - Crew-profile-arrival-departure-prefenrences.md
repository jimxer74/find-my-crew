## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
User can provide and save predefined preferences for departure and arrival locations, in profile edit, and in onboarding flow.

Considerations / questions:
- User can provide locations in various accuracy levels: e.g. exact location, city, cruising area like 'Caribbean" or very vague large area like 'Australia to New zealand' or 'Trans-atlantic from East to West' --> How handle the different levels or just plain text in profile

- how to utilize the location preferences in crew ui and searches and diffrentiate the in session filters from more static profile level location preferences?
