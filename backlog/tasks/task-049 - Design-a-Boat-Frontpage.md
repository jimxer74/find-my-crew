## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Design a Boat Management Hub that includes all the functionalities for owner to manage boat related information. 

Boat Management Hub or Boat Frontpage should be informative, provide often needed information at first, but also be pleasing UX / UI point of view. Boat Front page should facilitate further navigation to more specific functionalities such as:
- Update maintain boat basic information (likely not going to be used much after boat is initially created)
- Boat Maintenance log / manager (used a lot)
- Boat owners / crew handbook (to be read a lot, but seldom updated once created initially)
- Boat Voyage log
