Approval flows logic is based on the model where automation in approval is grandually increased from fully manual to fully automated approval process, 
starting from fully manual process:

1. Manual approval process
- Owner screens through the registrations data and does the assessment of registrations and crew profile data and selects which ones to approve and which ones to deny

2. Automated assessment
- AI screens through the registrations, crew profile data and journey / leg data to find good matches and makes a proposal to owner which
ones to approve and which ones to deny. Owner then makes to final call to approve / deny

3. Automated approval
- Owner can add new requirements for a journey to include specific questions or areas of knowledge and experience to be asked from 
crew candidates when they register to a leg
- AI screens through the registrations, the additional asnwers from candidates and assesses then against the requirements defined by owner
,crew profile data and journey / leg data to find good matches and auto-approves high matches, if not auto-approved, process continues as in 2. where owner 
can verify whether to approve or deny the registration

Additional Interview step can be mandated to 1. 2. flows, where candidate is asked to book an interview with the owner.
