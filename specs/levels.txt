Level 1 — Novice / Beginner 

Little to no previous time on sailboats (0–10–15 days total)
May have done a short introductory sail or a "try sailing" day
Understands very basic concepts (what a tiller/helm is, wind direction, points of sail) but cannot yet apply them independently
Can be a helpful crew member under close supervision (grinding winches, tailing sheets, basic safety awareness)
Cannot skipper even the smallest sailboat independently
Typical equivalent: RYA Competent Crew start / ASA 101 start / "Green beginner"

This level is about safety orientation, terminology, and getting comfortable on the water.

Level 2 — Confident Crew / Entry-level Skipper

Roughly 10–50 days on the water (mix of crew and helm time)
Can actively crew on most points of sail, handle basic maneuvers (tacking, gybing, reefing), assist with mooring/docking, understand basic rules of the road
Has skippered small boats (dinghies or daysailers <30 ft) in light to moderate conditions in familiar, protected waters during daylight
Can take the helm for short periods under supervision on larger cruising boats
Typical equivalents: RYA Day Skipper practical + some miles / ASA 104 Basic Coastal Cruising / NauticEd Skipper Level I–II / International Bareboat Skipper (entry level) 

This is the "I can safely take friends out for a weekend sail in good weather" level.

Level 3 — Competent Coastal Skipper

50–150+ days on the water, with at least half as skipper/master of the vessel
Comfortable skippering 30–45 ft cruising yachts as bareboat charter captain
Can plan and execute coastal passages (day & night), handle marina berthing in crosswinds/current, reef early, manage heavy weather tactics in moderate to fresh conditions (up to ~25–30 knots)
Good knowledge of navigation (electronic + traditional), weather interpretation, pilotage, and emergency procedures
Typical equivalents: RYA Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster Coastal / IYT Bareboat Skipper with experience / NauticEd Bareboat Charter Master Level III–IV / Most charter companies' "Level 2–3 Qualified Skipper" rating 

This is the most common level for confident recreational bareboat chartering in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, etc.

Level 4 — Advanced / Offshore Experienced Skipper

150–500+ days on the water (very often several hundred), with the majority as skipper
Extensive experience skippering sailboats in challenging conditions — strong winds (30+ knots), large seas, heavy weather, long offshore passages (multi-day/night), ocean crossings
Very strong all-round seamanship: advanced boat handling (including under storm sails or bare poles), heavy weather tactics, jury rigging, man-overboard in rough conditions, long-distance navigation & routing, crew management in stressful situations
Has likely completed long offshore passages (e.g., Atlantic crossing, multi-week voyages)
Typical equivalents: RYA Yachtmaster Offshore / Ocean / IYT Yachtmaster Offshore / NauticEd Captain rank + Level V / Charter company "Expert Level" rating with proven offshore resume

This level represents the serious, years-of-experience skippers who can confidently take a boat almost anywhere, in almost any conditions, while keeping safety margins high.Many charter companies and sailing communities use similar 3–5 tier systems, but this 4-level breakdown nicely matches the progression from "never sailed" → "can take friends out" → "confident charter skipper" → "seasoned offshore sailor".
