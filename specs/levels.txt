Beginner 

Little to no previous time on sailboats (0–10–15 days total)
May have done a short introductory sail or a "try sailing" day
Understands very basic concepts (what a tiller/helm is, wind direction, points of sail) but cannot yet apply them independently
Can be a helpful crew member under close supervision (grinding winches, tailing sheets, basic safety awareness)
Cannot skipper even the smallest sailboat independently
Typical equivalent: RYA Competent Crew start / ASA 101 start / "Green beginner"

This level is about safety orientation, terminology, and getting comfortable on the water.

Confident Crew

Roughly 10–50 days on the water (mix of crew and helm time)
Can actively crew on most points of sail, handle basic maneuvers (tacking, gybing, reefing), assist with mooring/docking, understand basic rules of the road
Has skippered small boats (dinghies or daysailers <30 ft) in light to moderate conditions in familiar, protected waters during daylight
Can take the helm for short periods under supervision on larger cruising boats
Typical equivalents: RYA Day Skipper practical + some miles / ASA 104 Basic Coastal Cruising / NauticEd Skipper Level I–II / International Bareboat Skipper (entry level) 

This is the "I can safely take friends out for a weekend sail in good weather" level.

Competent Coastal Skipper

50–150+ days on the water, with at least half as skipper/master of the vessel
Comfortable skippering 30–45 ft cruising yachts as bareboat charter captain
Can plan and execute coastal passages (day & night), handle marina berthing in crosswinds/current, reef early, manage heavy weather tactics in moderate to fresh conditions (up to ~25–30 knots)
Good knowledge of navigation (electronic + traditional), weather interpretation, pilotage, and emergency procedures
Typical equivalents: RYA Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster Coastal / IYT Bareboat Skipper with experience / NauticEd Bareboat Charter Master Level III–IV / Most charter companies' "Level 2–3 Qualified Skipper" rating 

This is the most common level for confident recreational bareboat chartering in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, etc.

Offshore Skipper

150–500+ days on the water (very often several hundred), with the majority as skipper
Extensive experience skippering sailboats in challenging conditions — strong winds (30+ knots), large seas, heavy weather, long offshore passages (multi-day/night), ocean crossings
Very strong all-round seamanship: advanced boat handling (including under storm sails or bare poles), heavy weather tactics, jury rigging, man-overboard in rough conditions, long-distance navigation & routing, crew management in stressful situations
Has likely completed long offshore passages (e.g., Atlantic crossing, multi-week voyages)
Typical equivalents: RYA Yachtmaster Offshore / Ocean / IYT Yachtmaster Offshore / NauticEd Captain rank + Level V / Charter company "Expert Level" rating with proven offshore resume

This level represents the serious, years-of-experience skippers who can confidently take a boat almost anywhere, in almost any conditions, while keeping safety margins high.Many charter companies and sailing communities use similar 3–5 tier systems, but this 4-level breakdown nicely matches the progression from "never sailed" → "can take friends out" → "confident charter skipper" → "seasoned offshore sailor".  


Questions for crew:

General:
- Do you have any dietary restrictions, allergies, or preferences that could affect meal planning (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, or aversion to canned/freeze-dried food)?
- Do you have any history of motion sickness or seasickness? If so, how do you manage it, and under what conditions does it worsen (e.g., high waves, enclosed spaces)?
- Are there any physical limitations or health concerns we should know about or medications that require refrigeration?
- What aspects of sailing excite you most, solitude, handling rough weather, stargazing at night, exploring ports, sightseeing or the camaraderie with the crew?
- Are you looking for a more relaxed cruise and downtime, or an intense, performance-oriented sailing with watches, sail changes and/or navigation challenges?
- Do you prefer structured activities like learning knots and sail trim, or more free-form time to enjoy the ocean and socialize?
- Are there any strong dislikes for you that would prevent joining the trip (e.g., lack of privacy, being cold/wet, bugs at anchor, long motoring in no wind, or crowded anchorages)?

Skills questions:
- Have you trained / do you have basic first aid skills?
- What is your sailing experience? (e.g., number of years/miles, types of boats—monohull, catamaran, dinghy and waters sailed: coastal, offshore, ocean crossings?)
- What certifications or qualifications do you hold? (e.g., RYA Competent Crew, Day Skipper, Coastal Skipper/Yachtmaster; ASA equivalents; International Certificate of Competence (ICC); Powerboat Level 2; VHF radio license?)
- What experience do you have with navigation? (e.g., reading charts, plotting courses, using GPS/chartplotter, dead reckoning, or celestial navigation basics?)

Coastal sailing:
- What appeals to you most about joining a coastal sailing trip? (e.g., exploring new harbors, beach stops, swimming/snorkeling, relaxed days on the water, learning basics, or socializing?)
- How do you picture a typical day, mostly sailing between spots, time at anchor for swimming/relaxing, or evenings in marinas with dinners out?

Offshore sailing:
- What draws you to offshore sailing (e.g., solitude, adventure, skill-building, camraderie / team activity?)
- How do you handle sleep deprivation or irregular schedules, such as night watches every few hours?
- What level of risk are you comfortable with—e.g., would you prefer to avoid passages with potential for storms, or are you okay with that as part of the adventure?

Skills
- Are you familiar with night sailing or watch systems? (e.g., standing watch, collision avoidance at night, lights/shapes, or using radar/AIS?)

Extreme sailing
- What motivates you to join an extreme expedition like this e.g., polar exploration, wildlife observation, scientific data collection, personal challenge, or historical routes like Cape Horn?

Skills and Experience questions:
- Have you trained in survival skills (e.g., cold-water immersion, crevasse rescue analogs for ice sailing, first aid in remote areas)? Any gaps we should address?
- Do you have firearms training and license and/or experience with polar bear deterrents? (required in places like Svalbard/Greenland)
