About me:
Hey everyone,
I’m a 19-year-old girl from Germany and will graduate in summer 2026.
For the time after I would love to combine my experience as a babysitter with my passion for sailing while working as an au pair on a sailing boat.
Since I have time till next summer, I am willing to commit for a long period and am open for the location 😉
I have German boat licenses for the inland and coastal waters, so I am very familiar with the theory of sailing, boating and navigation. But my practical experience is limited to the training boat and our own small sailing dinghy stationed at Chiemsee.
Concerning childcare, I have been babysitting a now seven-year-old boy for over 2,5 years now which has taught me a lot of patience and the love for achieving goals step by step.
This seems to me like a long shot, but I wanted to try anyway because I think it’s quite cool that these platforms exist.
I would love to hear from you!
