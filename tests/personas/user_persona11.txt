About me
My name is Morten Martinsson and I am based in Oslo Norway. I have around 25 years of experience with sailing and life at sea, and I have been on the water since childhood. I have sailed extensively in Norwegian waters and am comfortable with responsibility, routines, and safety on board.
I am a certified chef, so cooking on board is not an issue. I also contribute with sail handling, watchkeeping, navigation, and general maintenance where needed.
I have also previously worked as a sailing instructor for children. 
I am reliable, structured, and easy to work with. This summer season I am looking to spend as much time as possible at sea, both on shorter and longer trips.
If you are planning to sailing in Norway or need experienced crew for the summer, feel free to get in touch.
