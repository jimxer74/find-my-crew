My name is Juliet Everett, and I’ve been traveling around the world for the past 5 months. One of my main goals for 2026 is to learn how to sail and gain real experience at sea.
I’m currently looking for an opportunity to do boat hitchhiking / crewing, preferably in Africa, Caribbean or in Med. I’m more than happy to help with anything needed on board cleaning, cooking, general maintenance, or daily tasks, also navigation and standing watches.
I’m a teacher by profession, great with kids, and I can also help with their education or homeschooling if needed. I’m responsible, adaptable, curious, and always willing to learn.
If you’re looking for an extra pair of hands or know someone who is, I’d love to connect.
