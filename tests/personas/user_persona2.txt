Hello everyone, it is me again, but luckily in a new country!!! I will adapt my previous post to the new circumstances.
I am Alonso Ferrero from Italy, 25 years old and ready to learn :))
I am actually sailing from Thailand to Sri Lanka. This is my first experience, I am learning a lot and I am loving it. Anyway, I need to experience more and more, since I am convinced that my future will be on the sea.
Since August I have been living around South East Asia, volunteering around alone. When I left Italy my goals were: 1_ finding peaceful places to carry on my researches (since I am finishing a master in History and Anthropology, subjects that I deeply love); 2_ going back home sailing. The first seemed resonable and the second fool. But the reality proved different, just the contrary! Let's say that I found more adventure than expected.
I am planning to go back to Italy to graduate, but before of throwing againg the key and write a thesis, I want to fully enjoy my freedom, sensation that only the sea can give me.
After my graduation, I am planning to attend a proper course in order to become a skipper. I've always thought that sailing was out of my economic possibilities, but this year I felt a "call" and here I am.
I can do whatever kind of work, I am a really good cooker, nanny and cleaner. I can help with maintenance and I love to learn new practical skills. I have worked mainly as a waitress, babysitter, petsitter, in seasonal harvests, fruit markets and in a library. I can write, photograph and making video editing if necessary, I have a good camera with me.
I am a fast learner, engaged, adaptative, down to earth and sportive. I don't suffer any seasickness, I love the sea and I can swim for hours.
🍽 I don't have any particular need, I can eat everything and I don't need to drink or smoke.
🗣 I can speak of course Italian, fluent English, good but not totally correct Spanish and Portuguese and conversational Thai.
I can be talkative, I love discussing about everything with a good company, but still I usually fit in many contexts and I can adapt easily to what is required.
For any question, in private, I can give you my email, number and we can have a call or meet personally if possible. I can also provide references to contact.
...
I hope to come back home in style, still salty and brought by the wind.
I hope to become part of your crew! 🐙
Thanks and all the best to everyone🌻
