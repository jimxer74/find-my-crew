I have sailed from France to New-Zealand last year as a crew on different boats (monohulls and catamarans) from East to West. After spending one amazing year in this beautiful country.
I can do night and day shifts, steer, use paper charts and help with maneuvers, I don't get seasick and I love sailing!
l'm easy-going and I am always happy to meet new people.
I like to cook and can bake cakes and bread while sailing!! I also know how to clean fish so I can take care of the fishing 🎣
I love card games and i am slowly getting better at chess.
I speak French, English, Spanish and a little bit of German.
