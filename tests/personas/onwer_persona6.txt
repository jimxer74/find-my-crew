Sv Soulstice, Owner/Skipper Mark Craig
February 10, 2026
Jamaica—> San Blas, Panama
1 single private cabin available

Volunteer crew- no contribution or pay. On board meals are covered.
travel expenses are not covered
I’ll be sailing from Jamaica to Panama in the next weather window- hopefully on February 11. I have two crew on board. With 4 of us the watch schedule should be quite reasonable. We will clear out of Port Antonio and round the east side of Jamaica to put the seas a little more to stern for the trip to Panama. Assume 4-5 days at sea, plus whatever time is needed to get a decent weather window.
Soulstice is a 2005 Leopard 40 catamaran. I’ve owned her for 2 1/2 years and have covered over 5000nm on her. She has many upgraded systems, including new engines, lithium batteries, solar upgrades, as well as structural and cosmetic improvements. Onboard I have Starlink (limited use offshore), EPIRB, life raft (1 year past 4 year certification), Garmin InReach, and the usual requisite USCG required safety gear.
Experience sailing is preferred but not required. The best crews I have had were cool under pressure, respect each other, respect the ship, could follow instructions, showed initiative, and of course were good company. Basically, you can be professional when you need to be, and enjoy a chill vibe when you don’t.
Please message me directly with a very brief description of your experience and why you want to crew on Soulstice. I’m happy to put you in touch with past crew for references
