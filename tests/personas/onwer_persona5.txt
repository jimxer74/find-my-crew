CREW WANTED: Atlantic Adventure Aboard 47ft Sailboat
La Rochelle, France → Azores (Summer 2026) → Canary Islands → Atlantic Crossing (Dec 2026)
Seeking 2–3 experienced, easy-going crew to join a relaxed family passage. (Couples or female is desirable while my daughter is crewing) This is a non-paid, little contribution voyage—perfect for sailors craving real offshore miles and ocean camaraderie.
The Boat & Offer
47ft bluewater cruiser (well-equipped, safe, comfortable)
Private cabin + wet head (your own space)
All meals & provisions negotiable once aboard (excluding any special needs/requests)
Travel to/from La Rochelle (any other port) is crew responsibility as is immigration and other personal transportation
Current Crew
Captain: 46M, ASA and some USCG training, friendly, calm & flexible
Daughter: 17F, enthusiastic & helpful typical teen.
Your Role
Stand watches (flexible rotation)
Share light boat chores (cooking, cleaning, maintenance)
Bring good humor, reliability, and teamwork
Who We’re Looking For
Offshore experience preferred (at least coastal cruising required)
Friendly, adaptable, drama-free personality (must gel with small team)
Physically fit, non-smoker, comfortable with teens aboard
Bonus: Skills in navigation, diesel mechanics, cooking, or rigging
The Plan
La Rochelle → Azores (June/July 2026 )
Explore Azores, then Azores → Canary Islands (late summer,) for this leg, my daughter will not be on board… I may switch crew in Azores.
Prep in Canaries for Atlantic Crossing (Dec 2026) – crew welcome to continue if space and personality match. Already have extra crew for the crossing.
Stay as long as it works for everyone—no fixed end date. This is a rolling adventure.
