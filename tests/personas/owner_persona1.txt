𝟔. Contribution daily 10-50 EUR ( due to some bad experiences with people not getting this or worse, it has to be paid in advance) is the money I use to extra boat mantainance due to extra usage by more people. If we go in marina we share it and the food as well.
The concept is have fun together and visit places.
