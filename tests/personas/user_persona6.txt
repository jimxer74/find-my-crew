Good day everyone!
I´m Milbrook Meyhem, 42, and i´m looking for nice people with a boat who are searching a crew member to join their sailing adventure somewhere in  Scandinavia for any amount of time. 2 weeks, 8 weeks,...
- I learn how to sail in August 2025. I did an 5 days course at a sailing school on a lake in Germany and learned the basics. 2 times i charter that small sailing boat for a few hours and went by myself. Also i spent 10 days on a surf charterboat in the menatwais islands, so seasickness was not a problem at all. Now i want to learn how to sail properly in bluewater.
- I surf since 2008, since then i spent 6 month (Nov - April) in Indonesia (surfing) and 6 month (May - Oct) in Germany (working).
- I speak Bahasa Indonesia very well and i surly can help translate or talk to the locals direct during the trip.
- I learned mechanic and electrician in Germany (3,5 years apprenticeship), which could be very helpful on board.
- Also i like cooking and i know the nutrition of food we need.
- I been to many remote islands all over in Indonesia, so I know the area and loads of beautiful spots.
So yeah, I am ready and excited...
