Hello!

My name is Gregoramus Bilratinguis, I'm a 30-year-old frenchman (from Brittany), and I'm looking for opportunities to sail to Canada in the coming months (April/May/June/July) from Caribbean ! ⛵️

I sailed across the Atlantic from the South of France in early November on an Oceanis 46.1, then from the Canary Islands to Martinique on an RM 1070, and I'm currently sailing a Nautitech 47 in the Caribbean!

I also own a sailboat in France, a 1973 Dufour 35, which I've had since 2021. So I have some experience with boats, fiberglass work, mechanics, and everything related to boat maintenance and I can handle the night shifts quickly.

On a personal note, I'm a down-to-earth, easygoing, fun-loving person, very curious about all things nautical, easy to get along with, and above all, ready to tackle any task that needs doing!

Based on these experiences, I'm open to any suggestions, so if you're interested or know any Canadians who are sailing back, I'd love to hear from you!
