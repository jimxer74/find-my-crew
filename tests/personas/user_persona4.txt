CREW AVAILABLE
FROM: Mediterranean

AVAILABLE: from end of March / beginning of April
Hello everyone! My name is Indie Marrackeh, a French/Dutch traveler on a mission to learn how to sail and gain hands-on experience.
A bit about me: I decided life is too short to sit in an office all day, so I quit my NGO job in Amsterdam, gave up my apartment, and chose adventure instead. After solo traveling through Indonesia for a few months (I’ve traveled extensively before!), I’ve decided that 2026 will be my sailing chapter.
I’ve always felt inspired by people who leave land life behind to live and travel on their boats. That sense of freedom is something I aspire to and now it’s time to learn the ropes (literally!).
I recently spent a month in Greece learning the basics with a very experienced skipper. Now I’m eager to keep learning by doing, wherever I can. Currently, I’m in Nepal and ready for my next sailing adventure.
I’m a fast learner (especially when motivated!), positive, and enthusiastic. I speak four languages, love cooking, can contribute to expenses, and I’m happy to help with anything onboard including fishing 😉 and even babysitting if needed.
I’m hoping to find a boat with great people who are willing to share their knowledge and help me grow as a sailor while we explore together.
Looking forward to connecting and hopefully sailing soon!
Fair winds,
Sophie ⛵️
