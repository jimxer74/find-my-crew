I’m Kaitlin Skopoderm, 23, French-Swiss, just arrived in the Caribbean after a transatlantic crossing (Agadir – Canaries – Martinique).
I’m now looking to join a boat heading toward South America, ideally via Colombia, sometime in March. Flexible on dates and departure ports, as long as the bow points toward Latin shores.🌞
Comfortable at sea, easygoing, and always happy to cook for the crew. I also travel with a film camera and like to capture the salt of the moment
