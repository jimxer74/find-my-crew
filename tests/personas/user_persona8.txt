Hi! I'm new to this group. I recently joined because I am hoping to join a fun crew for some or all of March to further my experience and adventures with sailing and make new connections with other humans and breathe the wild salty air. I recently graduated from grad school and looking to spend some time on a boat before beginning a new career. I’ve dabbled with sailing a few times but haven’t set sail for a number of years since an old flame was lost at sea. He ignited the passion for sailing within me and it’s time to get back to those wild open waters. Please PM if you’re looking for a friendly crewman with a little experience on night watch but the willingness to learn more and the ability to cook a healthy meal and laugh for hours under the stars. I can speak English, Spanish, and French
