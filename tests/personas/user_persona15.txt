Motivated crew member looking for Atlantic crossing (East to West) – available all year
Hi everyone,
My name is Quentin Frigilio, I'm 26 years old, and I'm looking to join a crew for an Atlantic crossing to the Caribbean (no specific port of arrival). I'm setting sail in a few days from Gibraltar to the Canary Islands. 
This crossing is part of a long-term travel project: to reach the Americas and then travel from Alaska to Patagonia by bike 🚲 . Crossing the Atlantic by sail would be an adventure within an adventure.
⚓ My experience at sea
• Sailing on liveaboard sailboats
 • Areas: Mediterranean, English Channel, Atlantic
 • Approximately 30 days at sea in total
 • Role: crew member, assisting with maneuvers (sails, anchoring, port)
 • Able to stand watch, including at night after briefing
🧭 What I bring on board
 • Reliable, honest, and adaptable
 • Calm in stressful situations
 • Very comfortable with community living and confined spaces
 • No seasickness
 • Very good stamina
 • Cooking on board, organization, and logistics
 • First aid training
 • And for the atmosphere: tireless card/board game player, with a bit of a comedic streak 😄
ℹ️ Practical information
 • Available immediately
 • Contribution to the ship's cash fund
 • Valid passport
 • No medical restrictions
 • Languages: French (native), English and Spanish (bilingual)
