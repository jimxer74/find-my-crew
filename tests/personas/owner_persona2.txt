Crew wanted – Keerie Feeling 486
📅 March 12–24 (12 days)
📍 Departure & return: Martinique
👥 4 spots available

I'm paul 33year old belgian skippers. It's a collaborative boat I share it with other poeples and I want to share some sailing experience and some adventures with nice poeples.
I’m looking for motivated crew members to join aboard a Keerie Feeling 486 in Martinique.
The program will adapt to the wishes of the crew and the skipper: sailing, anchorages, exploration, and good vibes on board.
Bonus if you’re into kitesurfing or surfing 🤙
👉 Contribution required:
Participation in daily life on board (watches, cooking, cleaning, maneuvers, etc.)
Onboard kitty: €250 per person for the 12 days
Beginners and experienced sailors welcome — what matters most is a good team spirit and the desire to share a great sailing adventure.
