Hi! My name is Mathieu, I’m 30 years old, and I’m looking to join a crew heading to South America or Cape Verde!
I have a little over 800nm of experience (Mediterranean offshore and Atlantic). While I consider myself a humble novice, I am fully comfortable assisting with all maneuvers, standing night watches, and of course, helping with all the necessary daily chores on board. I’m eager to learn more and dedicated to being a useful pair of hands for a smooth crossing 🙂
I will, of course, contribute to shared expenses and I’m available to help with all the pre-departure preparations by your side.
📅 Practical Info
Departure Location: Las Palmas (or any other island in the Canaries)

If my profile interests you, I’d love to meet up at the marina for a chat, or talk via message/phone. I am serious, motivated, and fully committed to making this crossing a great human and maritime success!
Looking forward to meeting you,
