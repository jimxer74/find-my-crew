About the plan
Leg 1: Luperón → St Martin
In St Martin we may spend 2–4 weeks for resupply and minor refit. During that time we will definitely be doing day sails, boat prep, and team-building on the water to build cohesion before heading offshore.
From St Martin, we wait for a proper weather window and continue north toward Canada. A Bermuda stop is possible but not mandatory — weather will decide.
