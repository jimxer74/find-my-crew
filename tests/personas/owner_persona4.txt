II left Los Angles about four years ago. 29 countries, ~145 landings, and ~40,000 nautical miles—the vast majority single-handed.

This is not a delivery, but the goal is to move north efficiently while stopping as needed for fuel and weather. Planned stops include Panama, Costa Rica, (maybe - Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala) and Mexico.
Experience Needed: Minimal. I’m more than capable of handling the boat alone. Full stop. That said, the Panama Canal requires extra hands for line handling (I’ll also be hiring two professional line handlers, which makes things smoother). Heading up Central America, we’ll be sailing close to shore—especially through Papagayo and Tehuantepec—which makes rest and sleep harder. Having a couple extra people to stand watch helps a lot. In return, I’m happy to teach you how to sail or anything else you want to learn. Brass tacks: a positive attitude is what matters.
Schedule: Weather dictates. If you need to be somewhere within a couple weeks of the estimated arrival date, this is not the trip for you. I will not sacrifice my safety, my boat’s safety, or your safety to make a flight.
Cost: You are responsible for getting to and from the boat. Food costs are split evenly. Bonus if you can cook. More if you can bake. All responsibilities are shared. I cover all other boat expenses. Dietary needs are not a deterrent, but: I eat meat. You will be asked to cook meat. *Food costs are shared regardless of dietary preference
The Boat: '04 44DS. Fully equipped, safety-focused, and set up with redundancies on redundancies.Starlink (coastal use covered by me; offshore data extra), spare Starlink, two Iridium GO units, Garmin inReach, SSB, and two public live trackers for friends and family. Three cabins total — the captain’s cabin, V berth and benches in the salon, plus a hammock in the salon.
Captain: RYA Offshore. Very experienced. Thoroughly tested around the world in just about every flavor of conditions the ocean likes to throw at you. I’m in the home stretch of a long-held dream—sailing around the world—and yeah… almost there. I like to laugh, keep things light, and there are plenty of games and toys onboard to prove it. I’ll happily take the time to answer questions, explain systems, and show you how anything on the boat works. I do want to make one thing clear. I will not tolerate is dishonesty in anyway. There is a plank for that… kidding… mostly. In all seriousness: you’re stepping onto my boat and putting your life in my hands, and I’m doing the same while you’re on watch. Trust is key.
Extra: Your passport must allow walk-on entry to each of these countries. No drugs on the boat—zero tolerance, full stop. No drinking while the boat is moving, ever. At anchor or in a marina, a couple of drinks is fine. Personally I am six years sober and not interested in having drunk people around—not because it’s tempting, but because they are annoying. 😂
