Bequia toward Martinique/Bahamas
Hi everyone!
I'm looking to join a boat leaving Bequia in about two weeks headed north toward Martinique/Bahamas 🌺
Two months ago, I delivered the boat I'm currently on from Annapolis to St. Thomas and have been exploring the Caribbean ever since. Now it's time to part ways, as the captain is starting a yard period.
I'm open to any opportunities, whether that's island hopping or helping sail a longer distance, I have lots of offshore experience and am happy to provide references.
I love everything ocean and nature related and am always up for an adventure, can’t wait to hear from you! ☺️
